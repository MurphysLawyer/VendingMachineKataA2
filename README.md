# VendingMachineKataA2

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.16.

I wrote it to code the [Vending Machine Kata](https://github.com/guyroyse/vending-machine-kata)

## Design Phase

Before writing any code, I first outlined a high level design of the objects and how they will interact.  I also wrote some logic notes as I thought through various aspects.

Here are my design objects and notes:

### Model 1: This is a test
* Test 1
* Test 1
* Test 1
### Model 2: Test 2
* Test 1
* Test 1
* Test 1
### model 3: test 3
* Test 1
* Test 1
* Test 1
